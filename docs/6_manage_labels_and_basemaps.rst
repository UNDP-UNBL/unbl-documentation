There are several options for you to customize the base map. These include:

#. *Labels*: The labels show the name of the places, including countries, states, cities, and representative landmarks. Click the toggle on to activate labels, and click off to hide. 
#. *Roads*: Click on the toggle to show roads; toggle off to hide roads. 
#. *Map background*: We offer grayscale and satellite options for the map background. To toggle between these options, click the small window at the left bottom right of the screen.
