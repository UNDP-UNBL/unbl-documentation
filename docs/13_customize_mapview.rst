When selecting multiple layers, you can customize the map by adjusting their overlay order and opacity.

#. To change the overlay order, click on the |order| icon on the left of the layer name in the legend and move the icon up or down, as preferred. The top layer on the legend will be the top layer on the map.
#. To change the opacity, click on the |opacity| icon. Reducing the opacity increases the transparency of the layer. For example, to visualize both tree cover loss and protected areas, you can position the tree cover loss layer above the protected areas layer, and adjust the opacity of protected areas to 60%. This creates a map that shows tree cover loss within the protected areas, as well as the overall loss across the country.
#. To temporarily hide a layer on the map, click on the |hide| icon.To make it visible again, click on the |show| icon.
