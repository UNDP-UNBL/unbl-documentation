There are several features that can assist you to navigate the map screen. These include:

#. *Move map*: Use your mouse to drag the portion of the map you would like to view into the middle of the screen.
#. *Zoom in/out:* Click on the +/- icons at the bottom right of the map. 
#. *Center place*: Click on the center place button above +/-. This will re-center the map over the selected place.
#. *Hide left menu bar*: Click on the arrow at the top of the left menu to collapse the layer panel for a larger map view. Click again to expand the panel.
