Once your preferred workspace(s) are selected, you can use the Places tab to search for and select a location, as well as to view its associated dynamic metrics. Only Places accessible to your selected workspaces will be available. 

To search for an area of interest, you can either:

#. Click on the PLACES icon, type the name of the country or jurisdiction you want to view into the search box, and select the desired result in the search result list. 

*OR*

#. Click on the PLACES icon, click to expand the filters box, and select your filter of interest. You then can select the desired place from the search result list.
