How do I suggest more data for inclusion in the UN Biodiversity Lab?
====================================================================

We welcome suggestions on data that would enrich the UN Biodiversity Lab! If your data addresses biodiversity, conservation, or sustainable development at local, national, or international levels, please fill out `this form <https://forms.gle/AFqQf5dPZySQnhdq9>`_. 

Our team will review suggestions as they are received. UNDP, UN Environment Programme, and UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) have adopted criteria to assist in identifying and curating the best available data layers on these themes in order to enable more streamlined and standardised analyses and reporting. These selection criteria will place data into one of three tiers, and consider aspects like data relevance, open-licensing and availability, transparency, and geographic coverage. We welcome feedback on these criteria (available `here <https://www.new.unbiodiversitylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Global-Public-Good-Dataset-Criteria-v8_1-.pdf>`_) to help inform their development and the accompanying methodology. 

To upload data for your institutionâ€™s use in a UNBL workspace, please see the next question on requesting a UNBL workspace.
