#. Customize the view of the layers you selected, as desired. 
#. Use the screenshot function on your computer to capture the map.
#. For inclusion in formal reports or publications, please ensure you meet mapping standards:

   #. Maps should be clear and concise. 
   #. Important text on maps should be clear and legible (e.g., cities, place names, legend items, etc.). 
   #. The map should include basic mapping elements, including: a legend of relevant data layers and scale bar.
   #. The map must provide correct attribution(s) and citation(s) for the data source(s) used in its creation, either on the map itself or in a caption describing the map, e.g.:

*Examples*

(if within the map):
 
   Sources: Sanderman, et al., (2018); UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, (2021).

(if in a caption):

Figure 2 shows the estimated soil organic carbon present in mangroves (from Sanderman, et al., (2018)) within protected areas in Vietnam (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, (2021)).

*Also be sure to include full citations for datasets used in the references/bibliography section of the document, e.g.:*

   Sanderman, J. et al. (2018) ‘A global map of mangrove forest soil carbon at 30 m spatial resolution’, Environmental Research Letters, 13(5), p. 055002. doi: 10.1088/1748-9326/aabe1c.

   UNEP-WCMC and IUCN (2021), Protected Planet: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) [On-line], 02/2021, Cambridge, UK: UNEP-WCMC and IUCN Available at: www.protectedplanet.net.

Include information on the map (or in the citation describing the map) on:
- who created the map
- the date the map was produced on UN Biodiversity Lab
- and a note indicating that the map was created using UN Biodiversity Lab.

*Examples*

   Created by James Bond using UN Biodiversity Lab (www.unbiodiversitylab.org) on 14 February 2021.

**Finally**, ensure that you also include a citation for the map in the references section of the document. We recommend this format: 

Author. “Map title” [format]. Scale. (Date of Production). Map Generated on the UN Biodiversity Lab [web]. Version 2. UNDP and UNEP, [year].

*Example* 

Bond, James. “Mangrove Forest Soil Organic Carbon within Vietnam’s Protected Areas” [map]. Scale not given. (14 Feb 2021). Map Generated on the UN Biodiversity Lab (www.unbiodiversitylab.org) [web]. Version 2. UNDP and UNEP, 2023.
