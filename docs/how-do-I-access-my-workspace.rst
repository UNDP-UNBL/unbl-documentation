How do I access my workspace(s)?
====================================

If you are a registered user who has been granted access to UNBL workspace(s), please follow these steps:

#. Login to your account.
#. Click the MAP VIEW drop down button. This will display the workspaces you belong to.
#. You can view the assets (places and data layers) for each workspace independently, or all at the same time. Check the box for workspaces you want included in your view. Note: if no workspaces are selected, it is the same as having all workspaces selected.
#. Uncheck workspaces that you donâ€™t want to view. This allows you to only see the places uploaded to your UNBL workspace, and filter out unwanted assets. 

*Note*: we do not recommend you uncheck the UNBL public platform as this will remove access to the public global layers and dashboard metrics for all areas.
